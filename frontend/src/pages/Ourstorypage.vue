            Blogger is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can
            share knowledge and wisdom with the worldâ€”without having to build a
            mailing list or a following first. The internet is noisy and
            chaotic; Blogger is quiet yet full of insight. It's simple,
            beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right readers for
            whatever you have to say.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8 text-blacktext-black">
            Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective understanding of
            the world through the power of writing.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8 text-white">
            We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or
            empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most
            sensational and surface-level stories often win, we're building a
            system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for
            thoughtful conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over
            packaging.

            Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Blogger
            every month. They're software developers, amateur novelists, product
            managers, data scientists, politicians, stay-at-home parents, CEOs,
            and everyone in between. They come here to learn, to think, and to
            stay informed.

            We're building a place where ideas develop, take shape, and spread.
            Where what you read matters and can change how you think or see the
            world. We'd love for you to be a part of it.
